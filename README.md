# Andalucia Housing
Map generator and website showcasing independent research on the impacts of tourism on housing and gentrification in Andalusia, Spain.

## Usage

### Generate interactive maps for a website

Will create 8 maps: AirBnB & Tourist Housing in English & Spanish for Seville & Málaga

### Generate static maps for printing
```python3 static_maps.py```

## Future Work
- [x] Create README (😁)
- [ ] Add flags to map scripts to specify cities and languages
- [ ] Update requirements.txt (need to straighten out local environments)
  - [ ] Even better: Dockerize the whole thing
- [ ] Connect website text to Google Doc (requires investigation)
